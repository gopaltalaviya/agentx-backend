/**
 * x402 — HTTP 402 Payment Required, made to mean something.
 *
 * The message shapes follow x402 v1 (`PaymentRequirements`, the `X-PAYMENT`
 * and `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` headers, a facilitator's verify and settle), so a
 * client that speaks x402 recognises the conversation. The SCHEME is ours,
 * and it is named for what it is rather than borrowing `exact`:
 *
 * - `exact` has the client sign an EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`,
 *   which the facilitator submits. The test token has no such function, and
 *   more to the point an AGENTX agent's key lives in the signer, not in the
 *   agent — there is nothing for the agent to sign with.
 * - `agentx-directpay` has the client settle FIRST, through the facilitator,
 *   as a `directPay` on `TaskEscrow`: paid, settled and feedback recorded in
 *   one transaction, under the same caps as every other spend. The receipt of
 *   that payment is what goes in `X-PAYMENT`, and the worker redeems it once.
 *
 * So the payment is on chain before the worker does anything, and the
 * worker's only question — "was I paid, for this, and not already?" — is one
 * the facilitator answers from the chain and a one-row ledger.
