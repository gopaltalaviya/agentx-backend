   * reject. The client disputed work it had just been told was good, and the
   * worker's reputation took the hit for delivering it.

   * confused about, and models are far steadier at choosing a word from a
   * list than at anchoring an unbounded number. The cross-check it supports
   * — never pay on a verdict that contradicts itself — is a real guard again
