 *    spends, and only when asked.
 *
 * 2. **The demo cannot hard-fail.** Every provider being rate-limited,
 *    offline, or simply unreachable from a conference wifi is a real
 *    possibility on submission day. A recorded run is not a fake: it is the
 *    output the real models actually produced, replayed with its original
 *    timing so the demo still looks like thinking rather than a lookup.
 *
 * The recording is honest about itself — every replayed result carries
 * `cached: true`, and the demo says so on screen rather than pretending.
