/**
 * Try each brain in order; move on only when a provider is unavailable.
 *
 * The chain's ORDER is configuration (`BRAIN_CHAIN`) — a deliberate choice
 * about cost and quality. Moving along it is automatic, because a rate limit
 * at 11pm on submission day has nobody available to flip a flag.
 *
 * Two rules keep that safe:
 *
 * 1. **Falling through is loud.** Every result names the provider that
 *    actually served it, and each step logs a warning. Silent degradation
 *    means you discover the primary has been broken for a week during the
 *    demo rather than before it.
 *
 * 2. **Only `BrainUnavailable` falls through.** A schema violation is a
 *    prompt or schema bug that every provider will reproduce, so continuing
 *    would burn the whole chain, spend three providers' quota and bury the
 *    real fault under "everything failed".
