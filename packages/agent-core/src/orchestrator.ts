/**
 * The client side: turn one sentence into work other agents get paid for.
 *
 * plan → discover → select → hire → await → validate → judge → settle.
 *
 * ## Every branch is a real branch
 *
 * A demo fails on the paths nobody implemented: no candidate offers the
 * capability, the budget runs out mid-run, a worker accepts and goes quiet,
 * the result comes back the wrong shape. Each of those is handled here and
 * reported as an outcome, because an orchestrator that visibly recovers is
 * more convincing than one that never stumbles — and on stage it is the only
 * kind that finishes.
 *
 * ## Planning never sees a result
 *
 * The planner is called once, before any work comes back. Selection sees only
 * protocol facts — id, price, score — never an agent's own prose. Only the
 * judge and the synthesiser read worker output, and both run with no tools.
 * So an injection in a result cannot reach the call that decides what to
 * commission or what to spend. See docs/10 §1.
