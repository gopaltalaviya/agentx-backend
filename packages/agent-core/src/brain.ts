 * A `Brain` turns a prompt into a schema-valid object. That is the whole

 *
 * Every provider is reduced to this, which is what makes them
 * interchangeable. The interface deliberately does NOT expose messages,
 * tools, streaming or provider options: an AGENTX worker only ever needs
 * "given this task, produce something matching this schema", and a narrow
 * interface is what lets a rate-limited provider be swapped mid-run without
 * any caller knowing.
 *
 * Schema validity is the point. A worker's result is checked against the
 * job's `outputSchema` before it is accepted on-chain, so a result that
 * cannot satisfy its schema is a failed job and a reputation hit. Making the
 * model produce valid output *by construction* is cheaper than disputing it
 * afterwards.
