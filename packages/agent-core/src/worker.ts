/**
 * The worker side of the marketplace.
 *
 * One base class; a worker is then a capability, an output schema and a
 * sentence describing what it does. Everything below — polling for offers,
 * deciding whether to take one, producing a result, checking it before
 * delivering — is the same for every worker, and getting it right once is the
 * point.
 *
 * ## Declining is the strategy
 *
 * Reputation here is settlement-backed: a score only moves when a payment
 * settles on-chain, and a job accepted and failed is recorded as failed
 * forever. So a worker that accepts everything and fails one in five ranks
 * below one that accepts selectively and completes ~all of them.
 *
 * That is the incentive the protocol was built to create, and a worker that
 * did not actually exhibit it would make the whole claim decorative. So this
 * declines for two independent reasons:
 *
 *   1. **Structurally** — the client asked for output fields this worker
 *      cannot produce. Checked against the schema, no model involved, and it
 *      is not overridable.
 *   2. **By judgement** — the input is missing something the task needs.
 *
 * A declined job is not accepted, and the worker says so — off-chain, with its
 * reason, through the API. There is no "decline" transaction to pay for. The
 * client learns at once instead of after its accept window, cancels for a
 * refund and hires someone else; until 2026-10-07 a decline was silent, so a
 * run waited 45 s and then reported only "never accepted".
 */

/**
 * A confidence between 0 and 1, accepting the percentage models keep emitting.
 *
 * Asking for 0..1 and rejecting anything else is correct but loses real work:
 * the first live run had a worker produce a perfectly good report with
 * `confidence: 95`, fail its own schema, and deliver nothing — so the client
 * had paid and got a refund instead of a result. A value above 1 and at most
 * 100 is unambiguously a percentage, so it is read as one. Anything else still
 * fails, because it is not a confidence.
