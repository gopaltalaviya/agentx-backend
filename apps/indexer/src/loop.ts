/**
 * The retry loop around `tick()`.
 *
 * Extracted from `main.ts` so it can be tested without an RPC, a database or
 * a running process — the behaviour that matters here is what happens when
 * the chain endpoint misbehaves, and that is exactly what is hardest to
 * arrange by hand at the wrong moment.
 *
 * ## Why backoff, not a fixed interval
 *
 * A failing tick must never kill the worker: RPCs rate-limit, time out and
 * briefly 500. But retrying a rate-limited endpoint every two seconds is how
 * a brief limit becomes a permanent one — the limiter sees a steady stream
 * and never lets us back in. Backing off gives it room to forgive us, and
 * jitter keeps two chains (or two replicas) from synchronising into the same
 * pattern.
 *
 * Recovery is immediate: one success resets the delay to the poll interval.
 * A demo that took a minute to notice the network came back would be
 * indistinguishable from one that never recovered.
