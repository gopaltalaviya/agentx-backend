  /**
   * Start here, not at the deployment block.
   *
   * With no cursor `tick()` begins at `startBlock` and backfills every block
   * since. That is right for production — the history IS the record — and
   * catastrophic for anything that needs to see a transaction it just sent.
   * On Monad testnet the deployment sits ~1.6 million blocks behind the head
   * and `eth_getLogs` is capped at 100 blocks a call: about two hours of
   * backfill before the indexer reaches the present.
   *
   * The demo truncated the cursor on startup and then waited ninety seconds
   * for its own events. They were never going to arrive. Nothing settled, no
   * reputation was ever written, and five runs were misread as the agents
   * failing.
   *
   * An existing cursor is left alone. A restart that skipped its backlog
   * would drop real payments on the floor — this is for a FIRST start only,
   * and it is the same thing an operator wants when adding a chain whose
   * history they do not need.
   *
   * @returns the block seeded to, or null if a cursor already existed.
