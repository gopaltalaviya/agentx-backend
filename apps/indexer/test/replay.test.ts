/**
 * Replay safety — chaos checklist item 2, "kill the indexer, no duplicate rows".
 *
 * A replay is ORDINARY here, not exotic. The cursor is written after a batch
 * is processed, so any restart mid-batch re-reads it, and every reorg
 * deliberately rewinds twice the confirmation depth. So the question is not
 * whether logs get processed twice — they do — but whether processing one
 * twice changes anything.
 *
 * The events and payments tables were always protected by unique keys. The
 * reputation bump was not: it is `completed + 1`, and it ran whether or not
 * the event was new. Every replay credited the worker again, with no payment
 * behind it — inflating the one number this project claims can only be
 * written by a settled payment.
 *
 * These call `handleLog` through a narrow reach into the instance rather than
 * through `tick()`, because `tick()` needs an RPC and the behaviour under test
 * is entirely local.
