 * The real executor: an `Orchestrator` per run, streaming its events out.
 *
 * Built once at startup and reused, because the brain holds provider clients
 * and a recorded cache — constructing one per run would re-read the cache
 * file on every request and throw away connection reuse.
 *
 * Returns `null` when no model is reachable, so the API can start and serve
 * everything else rather than refusing to boot. A deployment with no key
 * should still show the marketplace; it just cannot start a run, and says so
 * with a real error instead of hanging.
