 * research-bot — market research.

 * these field names before the job is accepted, so the bot declines work it
 * cannot satisfy instead of delivering a result that will be disputed.
 *
 * `confidence` and `sources` exist because a research result without them is
 * unjudgeable: the judge is asked whether the work earned its payment, and
 * "trust me" is not something it can check.
