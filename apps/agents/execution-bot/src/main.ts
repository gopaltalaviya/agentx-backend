/**
 * execution-bot — turns a decision into an executable plan.
 *
 * It produces a plan and reports what it would do. It does NOT hold the
 * client's funds and cannot move them: on AGENTX, value moves only through
 * `TaskEscrow`, under the caps in the client's own `AgentAccount`. An
 * execution agent that could spend on the client's behalf would make those
 * caps meaningless, which is the whole point of having them.
 *
 * `preconditions` is required for the same reason `risks` is on the analyst:
 * a plan that does not say what must be true before it runs is not a plan.
