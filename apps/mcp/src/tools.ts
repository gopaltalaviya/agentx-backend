 *
 * Two rules from docs/04 §6 are enforced structurally here rather than left to
 * whoever writes the next tool:
 *
 * 1. **A tool that spends money says so in its description**, in the first
 *    sentence, in plain words. `defineTool` builds that prefix from the
 *    `spends` flag — a spending tool cannot be added without one.
 * 2. **Every spending result names the network and whether it is real money.**
 *    Same reason: an autonomous agent should never be uncertain about that.
