 * BIP-39 mnemonics, checked per line instead of with one loose regex.
 *
 * The obvious pattern — "twelve or more short lowercase words" — matches
 * ordinary English. It fired on the sentence "bug in this project passed its
 * unit tests and was caught only against the real", which is fourteen
 * consecutive 3-to-8-letter words and not a secret.
 *
 * The false positive matters less than what it would have taught: a check
 * that cries wolf on prose in every markdown file is a check people learn to
 * pass with --no-verify, and the same hook is what guards the actual private
 * keys.
 *
 * So this asks what a mnemonic really looks like — exactly 12, 15, 18, 21 or
 * 24 lowercase words, space separated, alone on a line or alone inside a
 * quoted or assigned value. Prose carries punctuation, capitals and words
 * outside 3-8 letters, and a sentence almost never lands on exactly one of
 * those five lengths with nothing else on the line.
