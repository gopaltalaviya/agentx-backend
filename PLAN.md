# AGENTX — Working Plan

**Stable reference. Task list, owners, dependencies, definitions of done.**
This file changes only when scope changes. Day-to-day state lives in
[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

- Created: 2026-09-22 · last revised 2026-10-01 (Session 29: M4-11, M4-12, M5-08 added at the owner's request)
- Deadline: **2026-10-13, 11:59 PM ET** ✅ verified
- Track: **4 — Trust, Identity & AI Infrastructure** ($30,000)
- Repos: 3 ([docs/06](docs/06-repo-structure.md)) · Networks: testnet first, both supported ([docs/08](docs/08-configuration.md))
- Built on **ERC-8004** — read [docs/09](docs/09-landscape.md) before any contract work
- Code: written by Claude · Keys, deploys, decisions: owned by you

## How to use these two files

| File | Purpose | Changes |
|---|---|---|
| `PLAN.md` | What we are building and in what order | Rarely — only on scope change |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Where we are, what is next, what is blocked | Every session |

**Every session starts by reading `PROGRESS.md`.** It names the next task and
carries the context a closed terminal loses.

Task IDs (`M1-04`) are permanent. Reference them in commits:
`feat(escrow): implement createJob [M1-04]`.

## M0 — Foundations · Sep 22–24

Goal: all three repos exist, build, and are wired together. A trivial contract
is deployed and verified on Monad testnet.

| ID | Task | Who | Repo | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0-01 | ✅ Confirm hackathon deadline + submission format | 👤 | — | — |
| M0-02 | ✅ Gather Monad chain facts ([07 §C](docs/07-what-i-need-from-you.md#c-done)) | 🤖 | — | — |

| M0-09 | ✅ `Deploy.s.sol` skeleton + `Makefile` targets | 🤖 | C | M0-08 |
| M0-10 | ✅ 👤 Run `make deploy-testnet` for MockUSDC; verify on explorer | 👤 | C | M0-09, M0-04 |
| M0-11 | ✅ ABI export script → `export/` | 🤖 | C | M0-08 |
| M0-12 | ✅ Decide package registry (GitHub Packages vs git dep) — **D1** | 👤 | — | M0-03 |
| M0-13 | ✅ Publish `@agentx/contracts` v0.0.1 | 👤 | C | M0-11, M0-12 |
| M0-14 | ✅ Install `@agentx/contracts` in B and W; prove the wiring | 🤖 | B, W | M0-13 |
| M0-15 | ✅ `packages/shared`: `JobSpec` / `JobResult` zod schemas | 🤖 | B | M0-06 |
| M0-16 | ✅ `.env.example` in all 3 repos — secrets + wiring only | 🤖 | C, B, W | M0-05/06/07 |

| M0-22 | ✅ Config fail-fast boot check with actionable errors | 🤖 | B | M0-21 |

**Done when:** a fresh clone of each repo reaches green CI; `@agentx/contracts`
is installed in both consumers; MockUSDC is verified on the Monad explorer.

**Risk:** M0-02 and M0-04 gate everything. If they are not done by Sep 23,
every date below slips one-for-one.

## M1 — Contracts · Sep 25–28

Goal: the money layer is correct. Spec: [docs/04 §2](docs/04-how-it-works.md#2-smart-contracts).

> **Revised 2026-09-22 by [09 — Landscape Analysis](docs/09-landscape.md).**
> `AgentRegistry` and `ReputationRegistry` are no longer built — ERC-8004's
> registries are already deployed on Monad. `StakeVault` replaces the custody
> they lack. Net effect: roughly breakeven on time, materially better
> positioning.

| ID | Task | Who | Repo | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1-00 | ✅ **Verify ERC-8004 on Monad** — done 2026-09-22 ([09 §8](docs/09-landscape.md#8-m1-00-verification--results-2026-09-22-on-chain)). Live on **mainnet only**; **absent on testnet**; both are ERC-1967 proxies | 🤖 | C | — |
| M1-00b | ✅ **Resolved 2026-09-22**: `giveFeedback` is plain `external` — a contract CAN call it. Also found: `getSummary` reverts on an empty client list; self-feedback guard → T17 | 🤖 | C | — |
| M1-00c | ✅ Deploy ERC-8004 Identity + Reputation to **testnet**; record in `deployments/10143.json` `erc8004` block | 🤖/👤 | C | M1-00b |
| M1-00d | ✅ CI check: mainnet registry proxy implementation has not changed from the pinned address | 🤖 | C | M1-00c |
| M1-01 | ✅ `interfaces/` — IIdentityRegistry, IReputationRegistry (ERC-8004), ITaskEscrow, IStakeVault | 🤖 | C | M1-00 |
| M1-02 | ✅ `StakeVault`: deposit, requestWithdraw, withdraw, slash, `isHireable` | 🤖 | C | M1-01 |
| M1-03 | ✅ ERC-8004 read adapter: `agentId` → owner, wallet, price, capabilities via `getMetadata` | 🤖 | C | M1-01 |
| M1-03b | ✅ Agent-card JSON generator + host (ERC-8004 registration-v1 schema, `x402Support`) — as an inline `data:` URI (ERC-8004 allows it), verified on chain Oct 1 | 🤖 | B | M1-03 |
| M1-04 | ✅ `TaskEscrow`: createJob, acceptJob, submitResult, approve | 🤖 | C | M1-02 |
| M1-05 | ✅ `TaskEscrow`: directPay fast path | 🤖 | C | M1-04 |
| M1-06 | ✅ `TaskEscrow`: cancel, dispute, resolveDispute | 🤖 | C | M1-04 |
| M1-07 | ✅ `TaskEscrow`: expireUnaccepted, expireUndelivered, autoApprove | 🤖 | C | M1-04 |
| M1-08 | ✅ `TaskEscrow`: fee capture at creation, Pausable, roles | 🤖 | C | M1-04 |
| M1-09 | ✅ `TaskEscrow` → `giveFeedback()` on settle, tags `agentx`/`settled`, `feedbackHash` binding jobId+specHash+resultHash+amount | 🤖 | C | M1-04, M1-00 |
| M1-09b | ❌ Off-chain `scoreOf` from `getSummary(agentId, [escrow], "agentx", "settled")` in `@agentx/config` — **cut:** superseded — scores come from the escrow's own settlement events (docs/04) | 🤖 | B | M1-09 |
| M1-10 | ✅ `AgentAccount`: execute + 5 policy checks | 🤖 | C | M1-01 |
| M1-11 | ✅ `AgentAccount`: session keys, allowlist, sweep | 🤖 | C | M1-10 |
| M1-12 | ✅ `AgentAccountFactory` | 🤖 | C | M1-10 |
| M1-13 | ✅ Unit tests: every transition, legal and illegal | 🤖 | C | M1-02…M1-12 |
| M1-14 | ✅ Fuzz tests: amounts, deadlines, fee rounding | 🤖 | C | M1-13 |
| M1-15 | ✅ Invariant tests I1–I8 ([04 §2.2](docs/04-how-it-works.md#22-taskescrow)) | 🤖 | C | M1-13 |
| M1-16 | ✅ `forge snapshot` committed; gas budget per hire recorded | 🤖 | C | M1-13 |
| M1-17 | ✅ 100% branch coverage on `TaskEscrow` | 🤖 | C | M1-13 |

| M1-21 | ✅ `SeedDemo.s.sol` — register 6 agents in ERC-8004 with settled history | 🤖 | C | M1-19 |
| M1-22 | ✅ 🔒 **ABI FREEZE** — Sep 28 | 👤 | C | M1-20 |

### M1 fallback (build **only** if M1-00 fails)

| ID | Task | Who | Repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1-F1 | ❌ `AgentRegistry.sol` per [04 §2.1](docs/04-how-it-works.md#21-agentregistry) — **cut:** not needed — ERC-8004 Identity is deployed on Monad (docs/09) | 🤖 | C |
| M1-F2 | ❌ `ReputationRegistry.sol` per [04 §2.3](docs/04-how-it-works.md#23-reputationregistry) — **cut:** not needed — ERC-8004 Reputation is deployed on Monad (docs/09) | 🤖 | C |

Cost if triggered: +1.5 days, absorbed by the M5 buffer. Decide on **Sep 25**,
not later.

**Done when:** invariants hold over 10,000 fuzz runs; 100% branch coverage on
`TaskEscrow`; all contracts verified on the explorer; a scripted lifecycle
(register → hire → deliver → settle → score changes) runs on testnet.

---

## M2 — Backend spine · Sep 29 – Oct 2

Goal: a hire settles end to end via `curl`. No UI.
Spec: [docs/04 §4–5](docs/04-how-it-works.md#4-database-schema).

| ID | Task | Who | Repo | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M2-01 | ✅ `packages/db`: Drizzle schema, full DDL from 04 §4 — **`chain_id` on every chain-derived table, all uniqueness per-chain** | 🤖 | B | M0-06 |
| M2-01b | ✅ Composite FKs preventing cross-chain jobs ([08 §8](docs/08-configuration.md#8-multi-chain-data-model)) | 🤖 | B | M2-01 |
| M2-02 | ✅ Migrations + `pnpm db:migrate` | 🤖 | B | M2-01 |
| M2-03 | ❌ Seed: 6 agents, ~300 settled jobs, realistic scores — **cut:** decided against — ~300 invented settlements would be fabricated reputation, the one thing AGENTX exists to prevent; the marketplace shows only real settled jobs | 🤖 | B | M2-02 |
| M2-04 | ✅ Indexer: viem event watchers, **one worker per enabled chain** | 🤖 | B | M1-20, M2-02 |
| M2-05 | ✅ Indexer: `jobs` + `job_events` projection, idempotent | 🤖 | B | M2-04 |
| M2-06 | ✅ Indexer: `payments` + `agent_stats` projection | 🤖 | B | M2-05 |
| M2-07 | ✅ Indexer: reorg handling via `last_block_hash` | 🤖 | B | M2-05 |
| M2-08 | ✅ Indexer: replay test — same range twice, tables identical | 🤖 | B | M2-07 |
| M2-09 | ✅ Signer: policy pre-check (same 5 rules as the contract) | 🤖 | B | M1-20 |
| M2-10 | ✅ Signer: per-agent nonce lock (Postgres advisory lock) | 🤖 | B | M2-09 |
| M2-11 | ✅ Signer: idempotency keys in Redis | 🤖 | B | M2-09 |
| M2-12 | ✅ Signer: key loading (per **C1** decision) + gas top-up | 🤖 | B | M2-09, C1 |
| M2-13 | ✅ API: auth (API keys, argon2id hashing, scopes) | 🤖 | B | M2-02 |
| M2-14 | ✅ API: `POST/GET/PATCH /v1/agents` + stake | 🤖 | B | M2-13 |
| M2-15 | ✅ API: `GET /v1/agents` discovery + 4 ranking modes, **always chain-scoped** | 🤖 | B | M2-14 |
| M2-15b | ✅ API: `?chainId=` resolution, `chainId` echoed in every response, `CHAIN_MISMATCH` / `CHAIN_NOT_ENABLED` | 🤖 | B | M2-14 |
| M2-16 | ✅ API: `POST /v1/jobs` with path auto-selection | 🤖 | B | M2-15, M2-12 |
| M2-17 | ✅ API: accept / result / approve / dispute / cancel | 🤖 | B | M2-16 |
| M2-18 | ✅ API: `GET /v1/jobs/:id/events` SSE | 🤖 | B | M2-17 |
| M2-19 | ✅ API: RFC 7807 errors, all codes from 04 §5.3 | 🤖 | B | M2-17 |
| M2-20 | ✅ API: rate limits, idempotency middleware, trace IDs | 🤖 | B | M2-19 |
| M2-21 | ✅ `scripts/e2e.sh` — full lifecycle via curl, asserted — as `scripts/e2e.mjs` | 🤖 | B | M2-20 |
| M2-22 | 👤 Railway: api, signer, indexer (+ optional workers) + Postgres — configs in `deploy/railway/`, runbook [docs/13](docs/13-deploy.md) | 👤 | B | M2-21 |
| M2-23 | 👤 Run `node scripts/check-deployment.mjs <api> <site>` against Railway + Vercel | 👤 | B | M2-22 |

**Done when:** `node scripts/e2e.mjs` passes unattended against the deployed
backend and asserts on-chain balances, fee, score change, and 5 `job_events`
rows.

**Fallback if the indexer overruns (decide Oct 1):** optimistic writes on
broadcast, corrected by the indexer on confirmation.

---

## M3 — Agents + MCP · Oct 3–5

Goal: the demo runs itself. **This milestone wins or loses the hackathon.**
Spec: [docs/04 §6–7](docs/04-how-it-works.md#6-the-mcp-agent-interface).

| ID | Task | Who | Repo | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M3-01 | ✅ `@agentx/sdk` — typed REST client for agents | 🤖 | B | M2-21 |
| M3-02 | ✅ MCP server: `discover_agents`, `hire_agent`, `get_job` | 🤖 | B | M3-01 |

| M3-11 | ✅ Prompt-injection containment ([04 §7.3](docs/04-how-it-works.md#73-prompt-injection-containment)) | 🤖 | B | M3-09 |
| M3-12 | ✅ `pnpm demo` — the full two-step trace, unattended | 🤖 | B | M3-10 |
| M3-13 | ✅ 👤 Run `pnpm demo`; send explorer links | 👤 | B | M3-12 |
| M3-14 | ✅ **x402 facilitator**: `POST /v1/x402/verify` + `/settle`, backed by `directPay` (P2 — cut first) | 🤖 | B | M3-01 |
| M3-15 | ✅ Worker endpoints answer `402 Payment Required`; accept retry with receipt header (P2) | 🤖 | B | M3-14 |

**Done when:** `pnpm demo` completes unattended, prints every jobId / amount /
explorer URL, and recovers visibly when a worker is killed mid-job.

**Do not skip M3-10 to save a day.** Live demos fail on exactly those paths.

## M4 — Frontend · Oct 6–8

Goal: make the invisible visible.

| ID | Task | Who | Repo | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M4-01 | ✅ API client + types from `@agentx/shared` | 🤖 | W | M2-21 |
| M4-02 | ✅ Marketplace grid: cards, tags, price, score, success rate | 🤖 | W | M4-01 |

| M4-07 | ✅ Explorer links on every on-chain event, via `config.explorerTx()` | 🤖 | W | M4-06 |
| M4-07b | ✅ Network badge on every page; network switcher if both chains enabled — badge; no switcher while one chain is enabled | 🤖 | W | M4-01 |

| M4-12 | ✅ Video guides — six captioned clips at `/docs/guides`, recorded live on testnet | 🤖 | W | M4-11 |

**Done when:** a stranger watching the demo page can explain what happened
without narration.

## M5 — Harden and rehearse · Oct 9–11

| ID | Task | Who | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|

## Open decisions

Tracked here, answered in `PROGRESS.md`.

| # | Decision | Needed by | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|

| D3 | Protocol fee paid by worker or client | Sep 26 | Worker |
| D4 | Name `AGENTX` available? | Sep 25 | Check npm, GitHub, submissions |
| D5 | Demo domain | Oct 6 | `*.vercel.app` is fine |
| D7 | Does the Safe Singleton Factory exist on Monad? | Sep 27 | Check; fall back to plain CREATE if not — nothing hardcodes addresses either way |
| D8 | Canonical USDC address on Monad mainnet | Oct 12 | From the Monad token list; only blocks a mainnet deploy |
| C1 | Key storage: Railway keystore vs AWS KMS | Oct 1 | Railway keystore for testnet, documented as a limitation |

**Resolved:** D1 (git dependency) · D2 (repos public — submission requires a code link) ·
D6 (**testnet first, both networks supported**)

---

## Cut list

Under time pressure, cut strictly from the bottom. Decided now, not at 3am on
Oct 12.

| Priority | Item |
|---|---|
| **P0 — never cut** | ERC-8004 identity integration · hire · deliver · settle |
| **P0** | `giveFeedback()` from escrow — **the entire differentiator** (M1-09) |
| **P0** | orchestrator running unattended (M3-12) |
| **P0** | live demo page (M4-06) |
| P1 | escrow path — direct-pay alone still demos |
| P1 | on-chain `AgentAccount` policy caps — strongest technical differentiator |
| P1 | `StakeVault` — answers the sybil finding |
| P2 | **x402 facilitator (M3-14/15)** — cut first, it is reach not thesis |
| P2 | dispute + arbiter (M1-06) → cut to a documented design |
| P2 | agent profile page (M4-04) |
| P3 | ERC-8004 Validation Registry (only if it ships before Oct 8) |
| P3 | staking UI — CLI is fine |
| P3 | score-over-time chart |
| P3 | 4 ranking modes → ship `balanced` only |

---

## Scope boundary

AGENTX is **rails, not a framework**. Anything that starts to look like a
general-purpose agent framework is out of scope, regardless of how interesting
it is. If a proposed feature does not make one agent pay another agent more
credibly, it does not ship before Oct 13.
