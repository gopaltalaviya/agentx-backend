#
# One image recipe for every AGENTX service:
#
#   docker build --build-arg SERVICE=@agentx/api -t agentx-api .
#
# SERVICE is the workspace package: @agentx/api, @agentx/signer,
# @agentx/indexer, or an agent (@agentx/research-bot, …). The chain facts the
# config loader reads — networks, parameters, deployed addresses, ABIs — come
# from `chain/`, a committed copy of agentx-contracts kept exact by
# `scripts/sync-chain-facts.mjs` (CI fails on drift). That is what lets a
# hosted build that clones one repo (Railway) build at all, and an image
# always carries the exact deployment it was built against.
#
# To build against a live agentx-contracts checkout instead, replace the
# `contracts` stage with a named context:
#   --build-context contracts=../agentx-contracts
#
# The runtime stage holds only the service and its production dependencies,
# runs as the unprivileged `node` user, and has no build tools, no source
# maps' worth of source tree beyond what the package ships, and no .env.
